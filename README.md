# PIC16-PTS
Note: This was a project for ECNG2006 at The UWI. St. Augutine Campus

A position tracking system that uses a 2 bit gray encoder to track the distance and orientatation of a vertical target. The project uses a 5V Axial BLDC Fan to blow across the HC-SR05 path. If the target on the encoder system is light enough, it may be rotated by the force of the fan. All circuit schematics as well as the breadboard layout is in the docs folder.
